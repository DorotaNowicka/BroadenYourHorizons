# Broaden Your Horizon

This web site has its own purpose, but you can use it to discover information about countries around the world. This purpose I had in mind as a context of this app.

## Instructions

In the destination folder run following commands to pull the code:

### `git init`
### `git pull git@github.com:DorotaNowicka/BroadenYourHorizons.git`

Then compile it:
### `npm i`

And run the app in the development mode:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
