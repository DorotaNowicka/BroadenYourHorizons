# Broaden Your Horizon

This web site has its own purpose, but you can use it to discover information about countries around the world. This purpose I had in mind as a context of this app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
